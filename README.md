This repository contains a single script that supports both Standard and Professional versions of OmniFocus 2. Functionally the only difference between the standard and professional support is the capability for the script to trigger a sync within OmniFocus 2, this can speed up the timing of items appearing OmniFocus 2 (dependant upon your email server, amount / size of mail being sent and the speed of OmniCloud).
